 * straight. This program uses a joystick to drive forwards and backwards while the gyro
 * is used for direction keeping.
 * 
 * WARNING: While it may look like a good choice to use for your code if you're inexperienced,
 * don't. Unless you know what you are doing, complex code will be much more difficult under
 * this system. Use IterativeRobot or Command-Based instead if you're new.
